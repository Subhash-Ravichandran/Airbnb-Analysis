# Airbnb Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the code and resources for analyzing and visualizing the Airbnb dataset. The project is aimed at exploring various aspects of Airbnb listings, including pricing trends, availability analysis, geospatial distribution, and location-based insights.

## Project Structure

- `1_MongoDB_Connection_and_Data_Retrieval.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for establishing a connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and retrieving the Airbnb dataset.
- `2_Data_Cleaning_and_Preparation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for cleaning the Airbnb dataset, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and preparing the data for analysis.
- `3_Geospatial_Visualization`: Streamlit web application for interactive geospatial visualization of Airbnb listings.
- `4_Price_Analysis_and_Visualization.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and visualizing price variations across different locations, property types, and seasons.
- `5_Availability_Analysis_by_Season.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for analyzing the availability of Airbnb listings based on seasonal variations.
- `6_Location_Based_Insights.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for investigating location-based insights, including variations in prices across different regions and neighborhoods.
- `7_Interactive_Visualizations.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for developing dynamic and interactive visualizations allowing users to filter and explore the data.
- `8_Dashboard_Creation`: Tableau or Power BI dashboard providing a comprehensive view of key insights from the analysis.
