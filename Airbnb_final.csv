13771436,1,"Source: Wikipédia Depuis les années 1980, le Mile End est connu comme un quartier à vocation largement artistique, peuplé par des artistes, des musiciens, des écrivains et des cinéastes. On y retrouve de nombreuses galeries d'art, des ateliers de designers, des boutiques et des cafés. L'entreprise de logiciels d'infographie 3D Discreet Logic a marqué le quartier en rénovant un étage d'une ancienne usine de textiles au début des années 1990. En 1997, cet espace devient les nouveaux studios montréalais du développeur de jeux vidéo Ubisoft, agrandis par la suite pour occuper la majeure partie de l'immeuble. Le Mile End est nettement plus fortuné et plus populaire depuis le milieu des années 1990 : l'augmentation des loyers et l'apparition de nouvelles boutiques haut de gamme en témoignent. Récemment, le Mile End fut considéré par plusieurs magazines musicaux spécialisés, notamment Spin et Pitchfork, comme le cœur de la scène musicale indépendante de Montréal.

Its most important era began with the construction of the Church of Lapa. Rococo and neoclassical building, the Church of Our Lady of Lapa began to be built in 1756 and finished in 1863. Beginning only with a Church, were added a College Seminary, a cemetery, and later, at the beginning of the twentieth century, a hospital.
